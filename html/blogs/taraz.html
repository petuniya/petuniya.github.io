                    Taraz (Kazakh: Тараз, تاراز, romanized: Taraz (listeni); known to Europeans as Talas) is a city and the administrative center of Jambyl Region in Kazakhstan, located on the Talas (Taraz) River in the south of the country near the border with Kyrgyzstan. It had a population of 330,100 as of the 1999 census, up 9% from 1989, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, after Astana and Turkistan. The current population of Taraz city is 428,000 (April 2023).[1]
                 of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan and in Transoxania, built and populated by the ancient Sogdians, Taraz celebrated its official 2,000th anniversary (recognized by UNESCO) in 2001, dating from a fortress built in the area by a Xiongnu Chanyu named Zhizhi, and was a site of the Battle of Zhizhi in 36 BCE.[2] The city was first recorded under the name "Talas" in 568 CE by Menander Protector. The medieval city of Talas was a major trade centre along the Silk Road. Talas was later described by Buddhist monk and traveller Xuanzang, who passed Talas in 629 and later wrote: "Traveling westward from the Thousand Springs 140 or 150 li, we come to the city of Daluosi. The city is 8 or 9 li in diameter; and was settled by Hu ("foreign, barbarian, non-Chinese") merchants from various nations. The products and the climate are about the same as Suyab."[3] The Talas alphabet, a variant of the Turkic "runiform" Orkhon script, is named for the town.

                Talas secured a place in history by virtue of the Battle of Talas (751 CE), which was fought between forces of the Chinese Tang dynasty and those of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. The battle took place somewhere along the Talas River in the Talas valley. One of its indirect outcomes was the introduction of paper to the West, via the Arab capture of Chinese paper makers.

                    Taraz, formerly (until 1938) Auliye-Ata and (1938–92) Zhambyl, also spelled Dzhambul or Džambul, city, southern Kazakhstan. It lies at the junction of the Talas River and the Turk-Sib Railway. Taraz is one of the oldest towns of Kazakhstan. It stands on the site of the ancient city of Taraz, which flourished as a stop along the Silk Road until it was destroyed by Mongol armies in the 13th century. A new town called Auliye-Ata was established on the site by the emirs of Kokand in the late 18th century. The fort and town were captured by the Russians in 1864, and between 1938 and 1992 the town was renamed Dzhambul for the Kazak poet Jambul Jabayev (Russian: Dzhambul Dzhabayev; 1846–1945). The modern city has large phosphate-processing works; a large power station; sugar, leather, and footwear factories; and a wool-washing plant. There are institutions for teacher and vocational training. Pop. (2006 est.) 336,057.
